This app gives the user the possibility to order some stuff from a restaurant.
The order is safed when the user closes the app with use of a sql table. 
When the order is ordered, a waiting time will apear and the user can place a new order.
The user has a way to see how many of each is ordered. 
The user is also able to delete all items of one kind item.
